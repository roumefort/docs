# Benchmark: SFML vs Raylib (Graphical Library)

## Comparison Criteria

### 1. Cross-Platform Support
- **SFML**: 
  - SFML is well-supported across multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
  - Its graphical rendering system is robust and well-integrated into the C++ ecosystem.
- **Raylib**: 
  - Raylib is also cross-platform, with easy installation across many systems. 
  - However, although it performs well, compatibility with some older or more specific platforms may not be as thorough as SFML.

---

### 2. Ease of Use
- **SFML**: 
  - While SFML is simple for beginners, it also offers deep functionality for advanced features like event handling, graphics rendering, and sound management.
  - The library is well-suited for large-scale projects.
- **Raylib**: 
  - Raylib is designed to be extremely simple and lightweight, making it ideal for quick prototypes or smaller games.
  - However, for more complex projects, its simplicity might become a limitation.

### 3. Performance
- **SFML**: 
  - SFML offers solid and consistent performance, especially for 2D games and lightweight graphical applications. 
  - It is well-optimized for handling graphical resources and window management.
- **Raylib**: 
  - Raylib is lighter than SFML and may offer better performance for smaller projects and simple 2D games. 
  - However, for applications requiring complex graphics, SFML is better suited.

---

### 4. Community and Documentation
- **SFML**: 
  - SFML benefits from a large developer community and detailed documentation, making it easier to resolve issues or add advanced features.
- **Raylib**: 
  - While Raylib is well-documented, it has a smaller community compared to SFML. 
  - Its documentation is, however, clear and focused on education and simpler projects.
