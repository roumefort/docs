## Description

This is the documentation for the R-Type project. This project is a 2D game based on the R-Type game. The game is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up game where the player controls a spaceship and has to destroy all the enemies in the level. The player can move the spaceship up and down, and shoot

## Server

The server is the main part of the game. It is the part that will handle all the game logic. The server will handle the game loop, the player movement, the enemy movement, the collision detection, the score, the level, etc.

## Client

The client is the part of the game that will handle the rendering of the game. The client will render the game, the player, the enemies, the bullets, the background, etc. The client will also handle the user input, the player movement, the player shooting, etc.

## ECS

The game is based on the ECS (Entity-Component-System) architecture. This architecture is a way to design the game. The game is divided into entities, components, and systems. The entities are the objects in the game, the components are the data of the entities, and the systems are the logic of the game.

You can find more information about the ECS architecture here and how to add new features to the game [here](./ECSDoc.md)
